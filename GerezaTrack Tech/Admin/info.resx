    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>In an era where technology has become an integral part of nearly every aspect of our lives, it's no surprise that correctional facilities are also embracing innovative solutions to enhance security, streamline operations, and improve the overall management of their facilities. One such pioneering solution is "GerezaTrack Tech," a state-of-the-art prison management system developed by DeniyzTech Solutions.
GerezaTrack Tech represents a significant leap forward in the world of correctional facility management. With its commitment to innovation, efficiency, and security, this system has garnered attention for its comprehensive set of features and user-friendly interface.
One of the cornerstones of GerezaTrack Tech is its inmate records management capabilities. The system provides a centralized repository for inmate data, including personal information, criminal history, medical records, and classification details. This centralized approach ensures that correctional staff always have access to accurate and up-to-date inmate information, ultimately enhancing security and administration.
Visitor management is another area where GerezaTrack Tech shines. The system offers a robust visitor management module that not only tracks visitor details but also verifies their identities. Real-time access control features empower staff to efficiently monitor and manage visitor traffic, reducing the potential for security breaches.

Inmate tracking within the facility is made more accessible and more accurate through GerezaTrack Tech. Correctional staff can monitor inmate movements, transfers, and interactions in real-time. This level of visibility bolsters security and safety efforts, providing staff with the tools they need to respond swiftly to any security incidents. Incident reporting is simplified with GerezaTrack Tech, allowing staff to document security incidents, disciplinary actions, and medical emergencies promptly. This data not only aids in investigations but also ensures that facilities remain compliant with reporting regulations.

Healthcare integration is another notable feature of this system. By seamlessly integrating medical records, healthcare professionals gain easy access to an inmate's medical history, medications, and treatment plans. This integration contributes to more effective inmate health management.

Parole and release management processes are streamlined with GerezaTrack Tech, automating notifications to relevant authorities and agencies. This reduces administrative burdens and enhances compliance with legal requirements. GerezaTrack Tech doesn't stop at real-time management and security features. It also offers comprehensive reporting capabilities that empower prison administrators to make data-driven decisions. These reports cover a wide range of topics, from inmate demographics to facility population statistics, visitation logs, and more.
Budget and financial management will also be integrated into the system, allowing administrators to effectively manage budgets, track expenditures, and optimize financial resources. This will ensure that correctional facilities remain fiscally responsible while providing essential services. Despite its advanced features, GerezaTrack Tech maintains an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
